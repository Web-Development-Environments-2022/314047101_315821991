- Using java-script, HTML and CSS.  

This is the classic Pacman game, with additional features we added.  

Functionality:
- You can sign up for the site, and login afterwards.
- You can change the game settings (buttons, number of ghosts that will chase the pacman, number of balls and their colors, game length in seconds).
- You will win the game only if you manage to eat all the balls before you run out of lives.
- During the game you will find:
 1. Clock - If you eat it, your playing time will double.
 2. Pill - If you eat it, you'll get one more live.
 3. Present - If you eat it, you'll gain 50 points.

<ins>The special functionality we added to the game:</ins>
- A clock Which doubles the initial game time once eaten by the Pacman.
- Pill that adds more life to the existing state of life once eaten by the Pacman.
- The monsters in the game move smartly- and try to catch the pacman.

Good Luck!
